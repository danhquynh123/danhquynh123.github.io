	The Yeezy Beluga 2.0 takes Kanye West's famous adidas sneakers full circle by returning to the colors of the first adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2. While the original colorway featured a bright orange (officially Solar Red) stripe across the side, the 2017 release of the Yeezy Beluga colorway is much more subtle. This colorway utilizes the same Zebra-like stripes as the original but the SPLY-350 branding is the only part of the upper with a contrasted color-this time called Bold Orange. The Yeezy Beluga 2.0 nickname comes from the similarities to the earlier colorway but the official colorway of this adidas Yeezy release is Grey, Bold Orange, and Dark Grey. The toned down color combo made it an appealing shoe for the masses compared to some previous Yeezy colorways. Despite rumors suggesting an October drop, the official release date for the Beluga 2.0 was November 25th, 2017. Since then it has been one of the most active sneakers on StockX, continually selling well above its retail price. You can get the Yeezy Beluga 2.0 on StockX now by placing a Bid or choosing to Buy Now.
