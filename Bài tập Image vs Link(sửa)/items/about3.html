	Kanye is back, this time with a brand new colorway of the Yeezy 500. Keeping it monochromatic, this pair is covered entirely in one color: utility black. Like other Yeezy 500s, this pair features a suede upper with mesh paneling. In addition, the midsole utilizes adidasâ€™ Adiprene cushioning technology. Releasing in July, 2018 this pair retailed for $200 and is now available to cop on StockX today.
