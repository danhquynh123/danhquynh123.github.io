	Released as part of the ‘The Ten’ collection from Virgil Abloh and Nike, the Off-White x Air Force 1 is transformed through the use of a translucent upper – an effect the designer calls ‘ghosting.’ Abloh characterizes this model as one of the most experimental designs from ‘The Ten,’ as it takes a foundational sneaker and radically reduces it, removing all the layers practically down to the padding, so that it’s still technically an Air Force 1, but just barely.
